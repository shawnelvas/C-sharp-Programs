## Task 7: Pattern Formation: Pyramid
1. **Input**
 
   `Number of rows: 4`
 
2. Use nested loops to iterate through the rows and columns:
3. for loop i=1 to iterate throught the rows;
 
3. for loop j=1 to iterate till `row-i`, "i" is the iteration head for the first loop
 
      - Print a space for the left padding
 
4. for loop k=1 to iterate till `2* iterated row -1 `
   which will provide even_no then minus one
   ` k<=2*i-1 `
 
       - Print the `*` in the inner loop
     - Move to the next line after the inner loop
