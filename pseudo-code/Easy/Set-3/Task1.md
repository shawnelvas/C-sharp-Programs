# Palindrome Number Checker

1. Input: The code prompts the user to enter a number using Console.Write and reads it using Console.ReadLine.
2. Reversal Process:

    int reversedNum = 0: Initializes a variable to store the reversed number.
    while (num != 0): Loop continues until all digits of the original number are processed.
    remainder = num % 10: Extracts the last digit of the original number.
    reversedNum = reversedNum * 10 + remainder: Appends the extracted digit to the reversed number.
    num /= 10: Removes the last digit from the original number.

3. Palindrome Check:

    if (originalNum == reversedNum): Compares the original number with the reversed number.
    If they are equal, it's a palindrome, and the appropriate message is printed.
    Otherwise, it's not a palindrome, and the other message is printed.

4. Output: The code displays whether the entered number is a palindrome or not.
